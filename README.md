# dominion-test
Experimenting with an FP-ish implementation of the card game Domppa, that also has another name.

The game consists of 2-5 players that during each game build a new deck of cards consisiting of actions, money, and points. The game board, meaning which cards are available to play, are randomised for each game as well.

The focus of this implementation is on the ruleset - to implement a _nice looking_ code base for the rule set, allowing complicated interactions of cards with minimal hacky card-specific code. UI is mostly an afterthought and is not intended for real play in any way.
